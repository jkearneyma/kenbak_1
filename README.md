# Kenbak-1 Reproduction

This repository contains schematics, PCBs, instructions and parts lists for the Kenbak-1 reproduction build which can be found at [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ffsnZ321Xv4](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ffsnZ321Xv4). Be sure to check out [www.kenbak.com](https://www.kenbak.com) for much more details on the Kenbak-1 and its operation.

## Resources

You will find the parts list, parts layout, literature (i.e. Theory of Operation), etc. in the tree of this repo.

## Main PCB

The original Kenbak-1 PCBs are pretty much non-existent. Therefore, if one has the desire to build a Kenbak-1 computer, they need to use a reproduction PCB. I believe it was Thomas Jones who created a reproduction PCB for the Kenbak-1. I used his copper layers to create the Gerber file (included in this repo). I then got the PCBs fabricated and made them available for sale at [www.kalinchuk.com](https://www.kalinchuk.com/product-page/kenbak-1-reproduction-pcb) for anyone wanting to build their own Kenbak-1 computer.
